# Internship-Automotive-Cybersecurity-Project
Developed a Python script that analyzed and visualized cybersecurity attack data on ECUs and BMS from Excel sheets. The script generated attack trees, helping teams quickly identify system vulnerabilities and improve decision-making. This project enhanced my data automation skills and contributed to strengthening automotive cybersecurity concepts.
